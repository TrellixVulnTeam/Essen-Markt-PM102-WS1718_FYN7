# ESSEN MARKT

Roughly one-third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year approximately 1.3 billion tonnes gets lost or wasted. It wouldnâ€™t be exaggerating if food waste is called a catastrophic problem globally today. When observed meticulously, it can be seen that most of the discarded food is still edible. When the technological advancements today are made in every field, why not as well have an application where tonnes of food can be saved from going to the bin where more than half of this could be eaten.

As a solution to the food wastage problem, this project is a simple web-based application where locals can share surplus food with another. Raw, cooked, uncooked, unopened; as long as the food is edible the food can be shared. All one must do is let others know that there is leftover food and put it on the application and someone will pick it up. One can decide to give away for free or for a little price. It is a simple application, where you have to add the leftover food and someone will pick it up and the surplus food is saved and not thrown away.
